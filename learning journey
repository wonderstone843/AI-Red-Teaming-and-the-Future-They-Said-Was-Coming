# My Learning Journey: From the Road to Red Team

I didn’t come into tech through a traditional path. I came through trucking.

Years on the road gave me space to reflect on how systems shape people’s lives — especially Black men like me, who are often boxed out of higher education by cost, bias, or circumstance. But the moment GPT-4 dropped, I knew it was time to turn the wheel in a new direction.

## Learning With AI, Not Just About AI

I didn’t just use GPT-4 to answer questions — I used it to challenge itself.

- I built **adversarial prompts** that mimicked real-world manipulation and misinformation.
- I explored how large models respond to **culture, race, wit, and social pressure**.
- I created **red team scenarios** that test AI’s judgment, tone, and vulnerabilities.

This wasn’t theoretical. It was practical. It was me, day in and day out, red teaming a system that most people were only just starting to understand.

## Applying Microsoft’s SC-900 Through Red Team Eyes

When I took the SC-900 course, I didn’t just memorize terms. I *tested* them.

- What does Zero Trust really mean if AI can be manipulated with the right words?
- How do we handle identity threats when attackers don’t need credentials — they just need clever prompts?
- What happens when cultural assumptions leak into model responses?

I turned every lesson into a testbed. Because learning only sticks when it gets challenged.

## No Tuition. No Gatekeepers. Just me and my drive.

I’ve been documenting everything — not just for myself, but for others walking this same road. I’ve done it with no degree, no formal bootcamp, and no debt. Just curiosity, discipline, and a mission to keep AI systems honest, safe, and human-aware.

This is what living the 2030 model looks like.
