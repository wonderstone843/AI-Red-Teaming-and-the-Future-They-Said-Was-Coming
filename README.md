# AI-Red-Teaming-and-the-Future-They-Said-Was-Coming



**This repo documents what it looks like to live the future of AI learning today — and why companies like Microsoft must reconcile their 2030 vision with their current hiring practices.**

> *“The future of education is AI-assisted, self-directed learning.” – Siraj Raval, 2019*  
> *“68% of current job skills will shift by 2030.” – Microsoft, 2024 Work Trend Index*

While Microsoft and other leaders in tech forecast that AI-driven, self-directed learning will become standard by 2030, the truth is — **some of us are already doing it.** We're not just theorizing about how people might learn differently. We're building, documenting, red teaming, and growing through generative AI in real time.

But there's a problem.

Despite predicting this shift, Microsoft and similar organizations still filter talent through outdated requirements — degrees, credentials, and checklists that don’t recognize what it means to *actually live the 2030 model*. That gap must be called out, studied, and closed.
