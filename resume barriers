# Resume Filters Are Blocking the Future

If Microsoft and others predict that AI-assisted, self-directed learning is the future, then why are the people living that future often disqualified at step one?

Here’s what I’ve seen over and over again in job listings — even from companies who say the world is changing:

## Common Resume Filters That Keep Us Out

❌ Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science  
❌ X+ years in a narrowly defined role  
❌ “Professional” experience over project-based proof  
❌ Certification checklists over self-documented mastery

These filters don’t recognize:

- self-taught red teamers  
- independent prompt engineers  
- people using AI to simulate, build, and test systems in real time  
- voices from outside the usual tech path — trucking, parenting, caretaking, creators, and more

## What Gets Missed When You Filter This Way

✅ Cultural insights from lived experience  
✅ Creative scenario design from non-standard thinkers  
✅ Fire and resilience from people who’ve had to build their own pipeline  
✅ Work ethic proven not by school but by output, discipline, and obsession

Companies say they want *diverse perspectives* and *unconventional problem solvers*. But when the resume filters don’t match the reality of how we’re learning, building, and applying — **you lose out on the very people shaping that future.**

## I’m Not an Exception — I’m a Signal

I’m one of many. There are more of us every day — learners, builders, testers, artists, analysts — who are bypassing debt, using AI to skill up, and documenting everything. If hiring pipelines don’t evolve to recognize us, companies risk getting left behind *in the very future they say they’re preparing for*.
